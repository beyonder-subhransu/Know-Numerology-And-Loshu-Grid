  const driverConductorInterpretations = {
    '1-1': `The Reign of Two Kings\n\nWhen both the Driver and Conductor happen to be 1, they form an unmatched leadership/authority alignment. This combination is rare and strong - two kings rule, their ambition and confidence amping up.\n\nRelationships: Passionate and intense. These individuals often form powerful bonds but may struggle with dominance issues. Mutual respect is essential to avoid ego clashes.

Number 1 brings strength, while Number 2 offers emotional depth.

    '1-3': `The King and Jupiter\n\nNumber 1's leadership qualities couple with the expansive wisdom of Number 3, which is ruled by Jupiter. This combination indicates intellectual development, creativity, and a skill for leading others.\n\nRelationships: Energetic and intellectually stimulating. Both partners inspire each other and keep life lively. However, they must take care not to compete intellectually or dominate conversations.\n\nChallenges: Their high intellect can make them overly critical or impatient with those who do not have the same level of thinking.\n\nCareer Paths: Education, consultancy, writing, and public speaking are all good options. They tend to be great mentors or spiritual guides.\n\n"Knowledge lights the path for the King."`,
    '1-4': `The King and the Gangster\n\nIt is a combination of Number 1's regal energy with Number 4's rebellious and unpredictable vibes. The result is a unique mix of creativity and strategy.\n\nRelationships: Unconventional and exciting. This pair thrives on challenge and intensity. Stability may be an issue, but the chemistry is undeniable. A dynamic duo that either transforms or self-destructs.\n\nChallenges: Such nature may lead to unstable circumstances if not handled in proper management.\n\nCareer Paths: Suitable places include politics, speculative venture, and entrepreneurial projects related to the most unconventional of industries.\n\n"When the rogue unites with the king, innovation strikes."`,
    '1-5': `The King and the Prince\n\nThis one brings together Number 1's tenacity with a dash of the flexibility, charm, and adaptability of Number 5. It is energetic and nimble and very likely a winning combination.\n\nRelationships: Playful and adventurous. These two enjoy life, travel, and exploration together. They need freedom and variety, so commitment only thrives with mutual trust and independence.\n\nChallenges: Their ambitious drive may sometime clash with their desire for freedom and spontaneity, leaving them unfocused.\n\nCareer Paths: Banking, finance, sales, and commerce suit them. They also flourish in areas that require communication with the public and skills in negotiation.\n\n"The King and the Prince conquer every arena with their synergy."`,
    '1-6': `The King and Venus\n\nThe majesty of Number 1 blends with the grace and beauty of Number 6, ruled by Venus. This produces a creative and harmonious individual with a keen eye for aesthetics.\n\nRelationships: Romantic and loving. This is a tender yet strong pair. The King leads with confidence, while Venus nurtures with affection. Love, family, and home life are well-balanced.\n\nChallenges: Their concern for aesthetics and harmony may sometimes lead them to lose track of practical goals.\n\nCareer Paths: Media, entertainment, hospitality, travel, and luxury industries like jewelry, liquor, or high-end fashion suit them well.\n\n"The King rules with charm and elegance."`,
    '1-7': `The King and Ketu\n\nThis combination combines the leadership aspect of Number 1 with the introspective and spiritual energy of Number 7. It produces a reflective, mystical personality who is quite inclined towards spirituality or research.\n\nRelationships: Deep and spiritual. The bond often feels fated. However, emotional detachment from one or both sides can create distance. Needs emotional openness and patience.\n\nChallenges: They may face problems of isolation, self-doubt, and the inability to express emotions. Their journey to success is often through overcoming inner conflicts.\n\nCareer Paths: Education, research, spirituality, and occult sciences are ideal for them.\n\n"The King embarks on a spiritual quest."`,
    '1-8': `The King and Saturn\n\nNumber 1 and Number 8 energies are highly contrasting; they create tension and often struggle. Number 1 is ambitious and optimistic while Number 8 brings in heaviness, delays, and obstacles.\n\nRelationships: Intense and karmic. Often tested by time and circumstance. Loyalty and shared hardship bind them deeply, but power struggles and emotional coldness can cause friction.\n\nChallenges: Delays, misunderstandings, and a lack of harmony are common. Balancing these energies requires patience and resilience.\n\nCareer Paths: Success is possible in industries involving hard work, such as manufacturing, construction, or law enforcement.\n\n"The King battles with Saturn's trials."`,
    '1-9': `The King and Mars\n\nThe most powerful combination is when the sun (1) and the mars (9) combined, making it an unbearable energy that cannot be stood against. It symbolises unmatched success and ambition.\n\nRelationships: Fiery and passionate. This couple ignites instantly with chemistry and shared ambition. If egos are kept in check, they can build empires together.\n\nChallenges: This combination can be very impatient or impulsive sometimes, but that is minor in comparison to their potential.\n\nCareer Paths: They do great in fields that need leadership, strategy, and action. Business, politics, and defense are good fields.\n\n"The King and the Warrior forge a legacy of triumph."`,
    '2-1': `Moon and Sun\n\nIt is one of the nice combinations involving the sensitivity of the moon with the self-confidence, charisma, and outgoing nature of the sun. People of this combination are balanced with an optimistic attitude, driven for success, and natural leadership with a strong emotional background.\n\nRelationships: With all that emotional depth and charisma, they are very caring and attentive partners. They thrive well in relationships where mutual respect and admiration are present. However, sometimes they can be over-analytical to the point of misunderstanding a situation at times.\n\nCareer Path: This combination fits careers that require leadership, creativity, and public engagement. Ideal professions include entertainment, politics, business, public speaking, or teaching.\n\nChallenges: While their confidence moves them to success, they are sometimes overcome with self-doubt when they feel low. They need self-discipline and emotional equilibrium.`,
    '2-2': `Double Moon\n\nMoon in both the driver and conductor positions intensifies sensitivity and intuition. However, the double effect can render individuals indecisive and overthinking.\n\nRelationships: These people are caring and sensitive partners, who are also very emotional. They live in a world of sensitivity and feelings. However, their unstable minds can lead to problems in communication and decision-making in relationships.\n\nCareer Path: They find success in careers that require a lot of emotional intelligence and creativity, such as counseling, writing, hospitality, or careers associated with water or dairy industries.\n\nChallenges: Their main challenges come from indecisiveness and problems with multi-tasking. They will struggle with handling complicated circumstances, thus often missing their opportunities.`,
    '2-3': `Moon and Jupiter\n\nIn this combination, the energy of the Moon is integrated with Jupiter's wisdom and expanse. Although this conjunction is not a naturally harmonic one, it does show potential for success in the intellectual and spiritual fields.\n\nRelationships: They are thoughtful and philosophical in relationships, and they value meaningful conversations and emotional depth. However, they tend to overanalyze situations, which creates misunderstandings with their partners.\n\nCareer Path: They are best suited for roles in education, research, teaching, or spiritual practices. They thrive in environments that encourage knowledge sharing and intellectual growth.\n\nChallenges: They may not find stability early in life because they need a lot of effort to balance emotional sensitivity with practical decision-making.`,
    '2-4': `Moon and Rahu\n\nThe combination of the Moon and Rahu creates an intense, unpredictable dynamic. Rahu amplifies the Moon's emotional tendencies, resulting in heightened sensitivity, overthinking, and fluctuating life circumstances. This is often considered a challenging pairing, as it brings periods of instability and confusion. However, it also offers the potential for profound growth through self-awareness and spiritual exploration.\n\nRelationships: Relationships are complex for individuals with this combination. They may experience emotional highs and lows, making it difficult for them to maintain steady connections. Rahu's influence can create misunderstandings or trust issues in partnerships. However, when they develop emotional balance, they can be deeply empathetic and devoted partners.\n\nCareer Path: Rahu's influence makes these individuals drawn to unconventional or modern fields. They may succeed in technology, media, marketing, aviation, or professions involving foreign travel. Their innovative thinking and desire to break boundaries give them an edge in competitive environments.\n\nChallenges: Emotional instability and confusion often plague these individuals, leading to indecision or impulsive choices. They may also struggle with unrealistic expectations or obsessive tendencies. Managing these emotions and grounding themselves is critical for achieving success.`,
    '2-5': `Moon and Mercury\n\nThis is known as the "mother-son combination," one of the most favorable pairings. The nurturing quality of the Moon complements Mercury's intellectual agility, hence creating a dynamic and effective personality.\n\nRelationships: Communicative and adaptable are these people, hence make very interesting partners. Harmonious, they love the art of using charm and wit to solve problems in their relationships.\n\nCareer path: Ideal fields include banking, finance, real estate, sales, and marketing. Their adaptability, coupled with communication skills, shines here.\n\nChallenges: They can sometimes overcommit and become stressed or burned out. Keeping focused without letting unnecessary distractions blur that focus is important.`,
    '2-6': `Moon and Venus\n\nThis combination will place the emotional depth of the Moon with the love for luxury and beauty by Venus. It's not exactly harmonious, but it can lead to middle-class success and a life of glamour.\n\nRelationships: These people are romantic and attached to their lovers. However, their material comfort needs can sometimes be at odds if not balanced with emotional needs.\n\nCareer Path: They are great in fashion, media, hospitality, tourism, or the sweet business (which symbolizes the Moon's milk and Venus's celebratory nature). They are unique in their creativity and aesthetic sense.\n\nChallenges: Overindulgence in luxury or material pursuits can prove to be financially unstable. They are successful if they have a balance between emotional needs and material goals.`,
    '2-7': `Moon and Ketu\n\nIt is both challenging and an exceptional potential combination. Despite material success, they seem to be very intuitive with spiritual insight.\n\nRelationships: Relationships can be problematic because of emotional ups and downs. They may not clearly express their feelings, leading to misunderstandings with their partners.\n\nCareer Path: Fields like astrology, numerology, psychology, research, or alternative healing are perfect. Their sharp intuition and interest make them natural investigators or mystics.\n\nChallenges: Their dependence on intuition makes them unpredictable in their decision-making. They need to build structure and consistency in their lives.`,
    '2-8': `Moon-Saturn\n\nThis combination usually faces many challenges because the emotional nature of the Moon clashes with the disciplined and restrictive energy of Saturn. Success only comes after much effort and perseverance.\n\nRelationships: Emotional tension can destroy relationships, because they don't have a healthy way to express themselves. They need very patient and understanding partners in their life.\n\nCareer path: Lawyers, technological experts, administrative personnel or metallurgists are given success in step by step process. They excel very well in a formal work environment.\n\nChallenges: The problems occur both in professional and personal areas of the lives and suffer from mental boredom. The development of mindfulness and emotional toughness is absolutely necessary.`,
    '2-9': `Moon and Mars\n\nThis is one of the most challenging pairings because nurturing Moon and aggressive Mars inherently oppose each other, leading to turbulence and conflict emotionally.\n\nRelationships: Relationships often tend to be marked with misunderstandings and power struggles. Their fiery temper can become unstable unless balanced with patience and self-awareness.\n\nCareer Path: Success may come in competitive or high-energy professions like defense, law enforcement, competitive sports, or entrepreneurship. Their drive and assertiveness make them effective in challenging roles.\n\nChallenges: Emotional volatility and failure to manage conflicts can undermine personal and professional growth. Emotional intelligence and mindfulness practices are essential.`,

    // 3-x
    '3-1': `Jupiter and Sun\n\nThis is a powerful combination where Jupiter, the good teacher, forms a union with the Sun, the leader. They form individuals who are disciplined, optimistic, and goal-directed. They are natural leaders with a sense of direction.\n\nRelationships: Loyal and generous, they cherish relationships based on mutual respect. They are very caring; however, their authoritative nature might overpower personal dynamics.\n\nCareer Path: This mix is excellent for education, politics, healing occupations, administrative roles, and even the occult sciences. Their magnetism and intelligence make them powerful leaders and influencers.\n\nChallenges: Over-confidence and intransigence and failure to work collaboratively can become bottlenecks to their achievement. They can acquire humility and team spirit to better themselves.`,
    '3-2': `Jupiter and Moon\n\nJupiter's wisdom joins forces with the Moon's emotional profundity, and the resulting person is well-balanced and empathetic. Although they may not excel at leadership, they are stellar collaborators and troubleshooters.\n\nRelationships: Empathetic and sensitive, they're caretakers of those they love and are frequently supportive partners. Yet their emotional tendencies tend to cause them to overanalyze or become hesitant.\n\nCareer Path: These individuals are good at education, milk industries, water works careers and hospitality. Their intuition also prepares them for a victory in counseling and coaching\n\nWeaknesses: They become emotionally unstable and make decisions based too much on emotions. They must learn to be logical thinkers to balance out the emotion.`,
    '3-3': `Double Jupiter\n\nDouble Jupiter placement adds more to the intellect of wisdom, knowledge, and spirituality. The individual is a visionary and an insatiable learner. However, with this combination, there usually happens to be strife in putting into practice the ideas.\n\nRelationships: They are loving and nurturant partners but appear distant because they are too absorbed in their intellectual world. The ideal partner should be one who is intellectually aware of their needs.\n\nCareer Path: Ideal places of work would be education, lecturership, stationery shop or any other business, occult study, and any student-life events. They are just great for work where they get to teach other people.\n\nWeaknesses: They like to take over more than one project simultaneously, which results in burnout. Great initiators but bad on completion, thereby making long-term success an issue`,
    '3-4': `Jupiter and Rahu\n\nThis dynamic blend unites wise Jupiter with ambitious, materialistic Rahu. While Rahu admires Jupiter, shared lack of alignment becomes painful, and the combination is effortful but certainly worth it.\n\nRelationships: It can be challenging in their personal life because the unbalanced energy of Rahu can cause misunderstandings among them. They need to communicate freely with one another to establish trust in relationships.\n\nCareer Path: They are good at sales, marketing, judiciary, and public relation sectors. They are flexible and innovative thinkers, so they excel in competitive and innovative fields.\n\nChallenges: It is difficult to keep ethics intact with the materialistic effect of Rahu. They should remain grounded to avoid being influenced by ambition.`,
    '3-5': `Jupiter and Mercury\n\nThis harmonious blend carries Jupiter's wisdom and Mercury's communication skills. They are often referred to as the Guru and the Prince, which makes for very flexible, innovative, and successful individuals.\n\nRelationships: They are friendly and eloquent and prioritize intellectual as well as emotional bonding. They succeed in partnerships that promote personal as well as professional development.\n\nCareer Path: They excel in media, voice-overs, banking, finance, and creative fields. Their excellent communication skills qualify them for public relations roles or behind-scenes creative work.\n\nChallenges: Dependence on intellect at times can make them emotionally detached. They need to develop empathy and concentration on emotional depth to achieve a balance.`,
    '3-6': `Jupiter and Venus\n\nJupiter and Venus are natural adversaries, and this combination will be tense. Jupiter is spiritual wisdom-oriented and Venus is material pleasure indulgent, which will have opposing motivations.\n\nRelationships: Marital compatibility will be difficult for this combination. Venus's love of luxury and Jupiter's sense of morality can trigger strain in personal relationships.\n\nCareer Path: Even with adversity, they can succeed in artistic pursuits like arts, luxury, or fashion. With diligence and determination, they can overcome hindrances to gain stability.\n\nChallenges: Poor health and inconsistency can hold them back. Cultivating self-discipline and mindfulness can assist them to stay focused.`,
    '3-7': `Jupiter and Ketu\n\nThis spiritual mix will lead to extremely philosophical and intuitive individuals with Jupiter's wisdom and Ketu's detachment, though they may not find material success with ease; intellectual and spiritual profundity has no equal.\n\nRelationship: Emotionally deep and meaningful relationships are the most important thing to them, though emotional expression is a little difficult. Trust establishment and good communication are what make those relationships last.\n\nCareer Path: They excel in education, administrative services, occult sciences, and healing professions. Their analytical mind and wisdom make them suitable for the job that requires strategic thinking and problem-solving.\n\nChallenges: Ketu's influence may cause a lack of focus or attachment to worldly matters. They need to develop practical skills to achieve success in tangible ways.`,
    '3-8': `Jupiter and Saturn\n\nThis blend of energy creates Jupiter's wisdom and Saturn's discipline. The outcome is a mixture between challenge and opportunity.\n\nRelationships: They are stable and practical partners but at times are not so self-assured in expressing their feelings. Stable and empathetic relationships assist them in thriving.\n\nCareer Path: The most suited careers would be for such careers as law, education, administrative services, or printing. Their disciplinary nature and awareness render them to fit into organized fields.\n\nChallenges: They face hindrances and tardiness in reaching their targets. Building persistence and continuity assists them in overcoming the challenges they encounter.`,
    '3-9': `Jupiter and Mars\n\nThis is a blend of Jupiter's intelligence and Mars's aggressiveness that creates individuals who are highly focused, active, and objective. Although it is not the most dominant, it equates brains with action.\n\nRelationships: They are ardent and faithful lovers, but there may be too much arguing as a result of Mars's fiery nature. Harmony has to be patiently and compassionately sought.\n\nCareer Path: They excel in dynamic careers, including defense, law enforcement, administrative positions, or very competitive business. They possess a sense of leadership and determination.\n\nChallenges: They are emotionally unstable and impulsive. If they are able to control themselves and become patient, then they will surely achieve their goals.`,

    // 4-x
    '4-1': `Rahu and Sun\n\nThis is one of the strongest pairings for driver number 4. Rahu's disruptive nature is balanced by the Sun's leadership abilities. Together, they form individuals who are driven, confident, and set on becoming great.\n\nRelationships: They are fiercely loyal and expect respect in relationships. But their controlling and bossy nature can create tension if not checked.\n\nCareer Path: This blend is best suited for political, business, and entrepreneurial pursuits. Born leaders, they perform well in high-pressure situations and can bring tremendous success by planning and taking risks.\n\nChallenges: Overconfidence and over overlooking of details could be disadvantages. In order to be successful in the long run, humility and patience need to be learned.`,
    '4-2': `Rahu and Moon\n\nThis pairing is a conflict between the high energy of Rahu and the emotional sensitivity of the Moon. The life becomes full of inner battles and conflicts, and despairing moments are quite frequent.\n\nRelationships: These people are emotionally unstable, insecure, and mood-swingers. Such types of people cause difficulties in personal relationships. They require understanding partners who can stabilize them.\n\nCareer Path: Careers in counseling, nursing, or creative fields can be an outlet for their emotional depth. Water-related professions or industries like hospitality may also suit them.\n\nChallenges: Depression and emotional instability are significant hurdles. Regular meditation and seeking balance through mindfulness are crucial for overcoming these challenges.`,
    '4-3': `Rahu and Jupiter\n\nRahu's waywardness gets balanced by Jupiter's intelligence and wisdom to create useful and creative individuals. The focus in this case is on flexibility and creativity thinking.\n\nRelationships: They prefer mental compatibility in relationships. Even though they remain committed, they fail to convey their emotions. This can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nCareer Path: They are excellent for marketing, teaching, and any form of job in the education industry. Their persuasive nature and creativity make them great at connecting with people.\n\nChallenges: Burnout is caused by overanalysis or overcommitting. It is necessary to concentrate on one objective at a time to be successful.`,
    '4-4': `Double Rahu\n\nIf Rahu occupies both the driver's and conductor's seats, such a life would be extreme and erratic with constant struggles, accidents, and falls. However, they will never give up and come back.\n\nRelationships: Intimate relationships can become stormy because of the unstable nature of Rahu. Trust issues and differences are very common, but open conversation can actually help clear things up.\n\nCareer Path: Sales, marketing, business, and law professions are most suitable. They excel in competitive and stressful situations due to their tendency to think outside the box.\n\nChallenges: Persistent struggle is the sign of this combination. Keeping going and getting help through guidance by mentors or counselors can help them overcome life's challenges.`,
    '4-5': `Rahu and Mercury\n\nRahu's courage complements Mercury's intelligence and communication abilities, making for a dynamic and flexible person. This blend is renowned for being witty, charming, and functioning well under stress.\n\nRelationships: They are charming and sociable and thus become popular people. But at times, their overthinking nature causes tension in relationships.\n\nCareer Path: Professions in media, banking, finance, and communication sectors are best suited. They are best suited for jobs that demand quick thinking and flexibility.\n\nChallenges: Restlessness and lack of concentration can be a stumbling block to long-term achievement.

Mars's aggressiveness clashes with Venus's desire for peace and luxury, creating quarrels. Marital peace becomes impossible without deliberate effort to settle disputes.\n\nCareer: Entertainment, media, and luxury sectors are appropriate areas for this combination. They would also do extremely well in professions that require charisma and boldness, like acting or public relations.\n\nWeaknesses: Relationship issues and controversies are extremely prevalent. Managing their impulsiveness and directing their energies towards positive activities can also help them thrive.`,
    '9-7': `Mars and Ketu\n\nThe combination of 9‚Äì7 brings the action-motivated strength of Mars together with the introspection and aloofness of Ketu. This generates spirituality, thoughtfulness, and courage. \n\nRelationship: There is emotional distance in the relationship. They are loyal and guarded but sometimes close-pretentious. They do well in relationships where they can discover personal space and freedom.\n\nCareer: Healing, teaching, and spiritual activities are well-adapted to this mix. They also excel at roles that involve courage and stamina, like social movements and disaster relief.\n\nChallenges: The greatest challenge is balancing their active and reflective nature. Transcending inaction and taking the leap can bring more achievement and satisfaction.`,
    '9-8': `Mars and Saturn\n\nThe Mars-Saturn combination provides a bold person with the discipline of Saturn. These individuals are determined, ambitious, and hardy in the face of adversity.\n\nRelationship: This combination makes for loyalty and commitment in a relationship. The opposing energies at times may spark power struggles. Respect and compromise are the ingredients for harmony.\n\nCareer Path: This mix is ideal for careers in law enforcement, the military, and engineering. They find themselves best suited to careers requiring discipline and bravery. They become top performers in their field in no time.\n\nChallenges: Delays and setbacks are natural since Saturn balances out the impulsiveness of Mars with a lesson in patience. Patience and planning are necessary to work through these challenges.`,
    '9-9': `Double Mars\n\nWhen both driver and conductor numbers are 9, Mars energy is intensified, making those who are extremely passionate and action-minded. But this combination also entails stability and balance issues.\n\nRelationship: People with strong personalities and independence tend to be explosive, as they fight easily. When committed, it is silently, and they seem to struggle with vulnerability.\n\nCareer Path: Roles involving activity physically or otherwise that brings some risk, leadership, or both are best for the combination. Entrepreneurship, defense, and sports are domains where they can put their energy into good use.\n\nChallenges: Their biggest challenge is controlling their intensity and not acting on impulse. Fostering patience and awareness can guide them in reaching their goals without unnecessary detours.`
